# Scout - A free and open source CMS for musicians!

Hi everyone,

My name is Giuseppe and I'm a pianist. I started working on this project when i thought: "Why there are free and open
source PHP applications for all, but not for musicians?". So I started working on this project that is really ambicious
for only one person, for this reason I decided to publish it on github. I need support of the Github community to make
my project bigger!

## About the first release

I don't really know how much time I need to publish the first release, it depends on how much Github users help me
fixing bugs/security issues and on how much time I can spend on the project. The name of the first release will be
*Rachmaninov*, because I think that Rachmaninov was one of the best composer in the world.

## How to install the alpha

Because the alpha version is destinated to developers, it's a bit hard to install scout, but not impossible.
Before trying to install remember that Scout requires at least PHP 5.4 and Apache 2 with mod_rewrite enabled.

1. Import the 'database.sql' file to your MySQL database
2. Go to "/scout/storage/configs" directory
3. Edit the "database.ini" file inserting your database connection credentials
4. Edit the "site.ini" file inserting your site credentials. Do not add final slash to the URL.
5. Go to "http://yourscoutinstallation/dashboard" to signin
6. To login use this credentials: email = spatyx@gmail.com and password = admin

## The license

The project is under MIT license, because is really flexible for users.
