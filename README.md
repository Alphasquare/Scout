# Scout - A free and open source CMS for musicians!

Hi everyone,

My name is Giuseppe and I'm a pianist. I started working on this project when i thought: "Why there are free and open
source PHP applications for all, but not for musicians?". So I started working on this project that is really ambicious
for only one person, for this reason I decided to publish it on github. I need support of the Github community to make
my project bigger!

## About the first release

I don't really know how much time I need to publish the first release, it depends on how much Github users help me
fixing bugs/security issues and on how much time I can spend on the project. The name of the first release will be
*Rachmaninov*, because I think that Rachmaninov was one of the best composer in the world.

## The license

The project is under MIT license, because is really flexible for users.
